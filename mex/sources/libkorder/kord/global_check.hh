// Global check

/* The purpose of this file is to provide classes for checking error of
   approximation. If y‚Çú=g(y*‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ,u) is an approximate solution, then we check
   for the error of residuals of the system equations. Let
   F(y*,u,u‚Ä≤)=f(g**(g*(y*,u‚Ä≤),u),g(y*,u),y*,u), then we calculate the integral:

    ùîº‚Çú[F(y*,u,u‚Ä≤)]

   which we want to be zero for all y* and u.

   There are a few possibilities how and where the integral is evaluated.
   Currently we offer the following ones:

   ‚Äî Along shocks. The y* is set to the steady state, and u is set to zero but
     one element is going from minus through plus shocks in few steps. The user
     gives the scaling factor, for instance the interval [‚àí3œÉ,3œÉ] (where œÉ is
     one standard error of the shock), and a number of steps. This is repeated
     for each shock (element of the u vector).

   ‚Äî Along simulation. Some random simulation is run, and for each realization
     of y* and u along the path we evaluate the residual.

   ‚Äî On ellipse. Let V=AA·µÄ be a covariance matrix of the predetermined
     variables y* based on linear approximation, then we calculate integral for
     points on the ellipse { Ax | ‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÇ=1 }. The points are selected by means of
     low discrepancy method and polar transformation. The shock u are zeros.

   ‚Äî Unconditional distribution.

/* This is a class for implementing the VectorFunction interface evaluating the
   residual of equations, this is F(y*,u,u‚Ä≤)=f(g**(g*(y*,u),u‚Ä≤),y*,u) is
   written as a function of u‚Ä≤.

   When the object is constructed, one has to specify (y*,u), this is done by
   the setYU() method. The object has basically two states. One is after
   construction and before the call to setYU(). The second is after the call to
   setYU(). We distinguish between the two states, an object in the second
   state contains ‚Äòyplus‚Äô, ‚Äòystar‚Äô, ‚Äòu‚Äô, and ‚Äòhss‚Äô.

   The vector ‚Äòyplus‚Äô is g*(y*,u). ‚Äòystar‚Äô is y*, and polynomial ‚Äòhss‚Äô is
   partially evaluated g**(yplus, u).

   The pointer to DynamicModel is important, since the DynamicModel evaluates
   the function f. When copying the object, we have to make also a copy of
   DynamicModel. */
