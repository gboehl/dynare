// Dynamic model abstraction

/* This file only defines a generic interface to a DSGE model. The model
   takes the form:

    ùîº‚Çú(f(g**(g*(y,u‚Çú),u‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ),g(y,u‚Çú),y‚Çú,u‚Çú)) = 0

   The interface is defined via pure virtual class DynamicModel. */

/* This is the interface to an information on a generic DSGE model. It is
   sufficient for calculations of policy rule Taylor approximations at some
   (not necessarily deterministic) steady state.

   We need to know a partitioning of endogenous variables y. We suppose that y
   is partitioned as:

        ‚é° static‚é§
        ‚é¢  pred ‚é•
    y = ‚é¢  both ‚é•
        ‚é£forward‚é¶

   of which we define:


         ‚é°pred‚é§        ‚é°  both ‚é§
    y* = ‚é£both‚é¶  y** = ‚é£forward‚é¶

   where ‚Äústatic‚Äù are meant those variables, which appear only at time t;
   ‚Äúpred‚Äù are meant those variables, which appear only at t and t‚àí1; ‚Äúboth‚Äù are
   meant those variables, which appear at least at t‚àí1 and t+1; and ‚Äúforward‚Äù
   are meant those variables, which appear only at t and t+1. This partitioning
   is given by methods nstat(), npred(), nboth(), and nforw(). The number of
   equations numeq() must be the same as a number of endogenous variables.

   In order to complete description, we need to know a number of exogenous
   variables, which is a size of u, hence nexog() method.

   The model contains an information about names of variables, the
   variance-covariance matrix of the shocks, the derivatives of equations of f
   at some steady state, and the steady state. These can be retrieved by the
   corresponding methods.

   The derivatives of the system are calculated with respect to stacked
   variables, the stack looks like:

    ‚é°y**‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ‚é§
    ‚é¢  y‚Çú  ‚é•
    ‚é¢ y*‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ‚é•
    ‚é£  u‚Çú  ‚é¶

   There are only three operations. The first solveDeterministicSteady() solves
   the deterministic steady steate which can be retrieved by getSteady() later.
   The method evaluateSystem() calculates f(y**,y,y*,u), where y and u are
   passed, or f(y**‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ, y‚Çú, y*‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ, u), where y**‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ, y‚Çú, y*‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ, u are passed.
   Finally, the method calcDerivativesAtSteady() calculates derivatives of f at
   the current steady state, and zero shocks. The derivatives can be retrieved
   with getModelDerivatives(). All the derivatives are done up to a given order
   in the model, which can be retrieved by order().

   The model initialization is done in a constructor of the implementing class.
   The constructor usually calls a parser, which parses a given file (usually a
   text file), and retrieves all necessary information about the model,
   inluding variables, partitioning, variance-covariance matrix, information
   helpful for calculation of the deterministic steady state, and so on. */
