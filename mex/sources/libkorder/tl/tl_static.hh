// Tensor library static data.

/* The purpose of this file is to make a unique static variable which
   would contain all other static variables and be responsible for their
   correct initialization and destruction. The variables include an
   equivalence bundle and a permutation bundle. Both depend on dimension of the
   problem, and maximum number of variables.

   TLStatic::init() must be called at the beginning of the program, as
   soon as dimension and number of variables is known. */
