// Integer sequence.

/* Here we define an auxiliary abstraction for a sequence of integers. The
   basic functionality is to hold an ordered sequence of integers with
   constant length. We prefer using this simple class rather than
   std::vector<int> since it is more efficient for our purposes.

   The class is used in index of a tensor, in symmetry definition, in
   Kronecker product dimensions, or as a class of an equivalence. The
   latter case is not ordered, but we always order equivalence classes in
   order to ensure unique representativeness. For almost all cases we
   need the integer sequence to be ordered (sort), or monotonize (indices
   of folded tensors), or partially monotonize (indices of folded tensors
   not fully symmetric), or calculate a product of all members or only of
   a part (used in Kronecker product dimensions). When we calculate
   offsets in folded tensors, we need to obtain a number of the same
   items in the front (getPrefixLength()), and also to add some integer
   number to all items.

   Also, we need to construct a subsequence of a sequence. */

/* The implementation of IntSequence is straightforward. It has a pointer

   to the pointer and a ‘length’ of the sequence.

   WARNING: IntSequence(n) and IntSequence{n} are not the same (parentheses
   versus braces). The former initializes a sequence of length n, while the
   latter constructs a sequence of a single element equal to n. This is similar
   to the behaviour of std::vector. */
