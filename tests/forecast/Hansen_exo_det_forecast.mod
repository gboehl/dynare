* The Hansen model following McCandless, George T. (2008): The ABCs of RBCs, Hardvard University Press, Chapter 6
*
* This mod-file tests the correctness of forecasting with exogenous deterministic variables.
* A forecast starting at the steady state in t=0, where the only shock is a perfectly 
* anticipated shock in t=8, is equal to the IRF to a 7 period anticipated news shock.
* Note the timing difference due to the fact that in forecasting. the agent starts at the 
* steady state at time 0 and has the first endogenous reaction period at t=1 so that the shock at 
* t=8 is only 7 period anticipated

* This implementation was written by Johannes Pfeifer. Please note that the
* following copyright notice only applies to this Dynare implementation of the
* model.
