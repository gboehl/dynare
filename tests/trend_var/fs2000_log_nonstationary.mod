/*
 * This file is a modified version of 'fs2000.mod'.
 *
 * The difference is that, here, the equations are written in non-stationary form,
 * all variables are taken in logs, and Dynare automatically does the detrending.
 *
 * Also note that "m" and "dA" in 'fs2000.mod' are here called "gM" and "gA"
