;;; TODO:
;;    - font-locking:
;;      + external functions (font-lock-function-name-face),
;;      + change face for macroprocessor?
;;      + handle dates?
;;      + multi-line macro-commands/exprs
;;    - M-a and M-e should skip statements (separated with ;)
;;    - improve indentation
;;      + w.r.t. to statements/equations/macro-commands split on several lines
;;      + for macro-statements (insert space between @# and the keyword, with
;;        an option for controlling this offset)
;;      + add option for controlling whether macrocommands are indented at 0 or
;;        at same level as Dynare code
;;    - basically deactivate the mode within verbatim blocks?
;;    - blocks templates "model/end", "initval/end", etc.
;;    - functions to insert main keywords, with shortcuts in the keymap
;;    - make font-locking case insensitive (as is Dynare lexer)
