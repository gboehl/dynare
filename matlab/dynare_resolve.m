% function [A,B,ys,info,M_,options_,oo_] = dynare_resolve(M_,options_,oo_,mode)
% Computes the linear approximation and the matrices A and B of the transition equation.
%
% Inputs:
% - M_                  [structure]     Matlab's structure describing the model
% - options_            [structure]     Matlab's structure containing the options
% - oo_                 [structure]     Matlab's structure containing the results
% - mode                [string]        if provided, use restricted state space
%
% Outputs:
% - A                   [double]        State transition matrix (potentially for restricted state space)
% - B                   [double]        shock impact matrix (potentially for restricted state space)
% - ys                  [double]        vector of steady state values
% - info                [double]        4 by 1 vector with exit flag and information
% - M_                  [structure]     Matlab's structure describing the model
% - oo_                 [structure]     Matlab's structure containing the results
