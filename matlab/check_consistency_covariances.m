function correct_flag=check_consistency_covariances(Covariance_matrix)
% function check_consistency_covariances(Covariance_matrix)
% checks consistency of covariance matrices by checking whether the
% covariances imply correlations bigger than 1.
%
% Outputs: correct_flag         [scalar] 0 if not consistent, 1 otherwise
% Inputs: Covariance_matrix     [matrix] covariance matrix to be checked
