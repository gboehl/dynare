function xcum = priorcdf(para, pshape, p6, p7, p3, p4)

% This procedure transforms x vectors into cumulative values
% pshape: 0 is point mass, both para and p2 are ignored
%         1 is BETA(mean,stdd)
%         2 is GAMMA(mean,stdd)
%         3 is NORMAL(mean,stdd)
%         4 is INVGAMMA(s^2,nu) type I
%         5 is UNIFORM [p1,p2]
%         6 is INNGAMMA(s^2,nu) type II
%         8 is WEIBULL(s, k)
