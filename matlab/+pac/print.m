function print(pacexpectationmodelname, eqname, withcalibration)

% Prints the exansion of the PAC_EXPECTATION term in files.
%
% INPUTS
% - pacexpectationmodelname       [string]     Name of the expectation model.
% - eqname                         [string]    Name of the equation.
% - withcalibration                [logical]   Prints calibration if true.

%
% REMARKS
% The routine creates two text files
%
% - {pacexpectationmodelname}-parameters.inc     which contains the declaration of the parameters specific to the expectation model kind term.
% - {pacexpectationmodelname}-expression.inc     which contains the expanded version of the expectation model kind term.
%
% These routines are saved under the {modfilename}/model/pacexpectationmodel subfolder, and can be
% used after in another mod file (ie included with the macro directive @#include).
