function [y,dy] = bivmom(p,rho)
% Computes the product moment (and its derivative with respect to standard
% errors and correlation parameters) of X_1^{p_1}X_2^{p_2}, where X_1 and X_2
% are standard bivariate normally distributed.
% n : dimension of X
% rho: correlation coefficient between X_1 and X_2
% =========================================================================
% INPUTS
%   p   [2 by 1]    powers of X_{1} and X_{2}
%   rho [1 by 1]    correlation coefficient between X_1 and X_2
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% OUTPUTS
%   y   [1 by 1]    product moment E[X_1^{p_1}X_2^{p_2}]
%   dy  [1 by 1]    derivative of y wrt to rho
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
