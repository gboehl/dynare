function b = isauxiliary(var, types)

% Returns true if var is an auxiliary variable.
%
% INPUTS
% - var       [string]    Name of the variable.
% - types     [integer]  vector of type of auxiliary variables.
%
% OUTPUTS
% - b         [logical]
%
% REMARKS
%
% Types for auxiliary variables are as follows:
%
%   -  0,    Lead on endogenous variable (substitute for endo leads >= 2)
%   -  1,    Lag on endogenous variable (ubstitute for endo lags >= 2)
%   -  2,    Lead on exogenous variable  (ubstitute for exo leads >= 1)
%   -  3,    Lag on exogenous variable (substitute for exo lags >= 1)
%   -  4     Expectation (substitute for Expectation Operator)
%   -  5,    Diff forward (substitute for the differentiate of a forward variable)
%   -  6,    Multipliers for FOC of Ramsey Problem
%   -  7,    currently not used, see SymbolTable.hh
%   -  8,    Variable for Diff operator
%   -  9,    Lag on Diff
%   - 10,    Variable created when diff was taken of unary operator (log, exp)
%   - 11,    Lead on Diff
