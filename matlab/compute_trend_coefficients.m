%
% INPUTS
%   M_              [structure] describing the model; called in the eval
%                               statement
%   DynareOptions   [structure] describing the options
%   nvarobs         [scalar]    number of observed variables
%   ntobs           [scalar]    length of data sample for estimation
%
% OUTPUTS
