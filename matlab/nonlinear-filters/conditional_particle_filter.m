function [LIK,lik] = conditional_particle_filter(ReducedForm, Y, s, ParticleOptions, ThreadsOptions, DynareOptions, Model)

% Evaluates the likelihood of a non-linear model with a particle filter
%
% INPUTS
% - ReducedForm        [structure]    Matlab's structure describing the reduced form model.
% - Y                  [double]       p×T matrix of (detrended) data, where p is the number of observed variables.
% - s                  [integer]      scalar, likelihood evaluation starts at s (has to be smaller than T, the sample length provided in Y).
% - ParticlesOptions   [struct]
% - ThreadsOptions     [struct]
% - DynareOptions      [struct]
% - Model              [struct]
%
% OUTPUTS
% - LIK                [double]    scalar, likelihood
% - lik                [double]    (T-s+1)×1 vector, density of observations in each period.
%
% REMARKS
% - The proposal is built using the Kalman updating step for each particle.
% - we need draws in the errors distributions
% Whether we use Monte-Carlo draws from a multivariate gaussian distribution
% as in Amisano & Tristani (JEDC 2010).
% Whether we use multidimensional Gaussian sparse grids approximations:
% - a univariate Kronrod-Paterson Gaussian quadrature combined by the Smolyak
% operator (ref: Winschel & Kratzig, 2010).
% - a spherical-radial cubature (ref: Arasaratnam & Haykin, 2009a,2009b).
% - a scaled unscented transform cubature (ref: Julier & Uhlmann 1997, van der
% Merwe & Wan 2003).
%
% Pros:
% - Allows using current observable information in the proposal
% - The use of sparse grids Gaussian approximation is much faster than the Monte-Carlo approach
% Cons:
% - The use of the Kalman updating step may biais the proposal distribution since
% it has been derived in a linear context and is implemented in a nonlinear
% context. That is why particle resampling is performed.
