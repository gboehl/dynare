% Elements to calculate the importance sampling ratio
%
% INPUTS
%    reduced_form_model     [structure] Matlab's structure describing the reduced form model.
%                                       reduced_form_model.measurement.H   [double]   (pp x pp) variance matrix of measurement errors.
%                                       reduced_form_model.state.Q         [double]   (qq x qq) variance matrix of state errors.
%                                       reduced_form_model.state.dr        [structure] output of resol.m.
%    Y                      [double]    pp*smpl matrix of (detrended) data, where pp is the maximum number of observed variables.
%    start                  [integer]   scalar, likelihood evaluation starts at 'start'.
%    smolyak_accuracy       [integer]   scalar.
