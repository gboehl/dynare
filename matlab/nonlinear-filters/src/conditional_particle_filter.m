function [LIK,lik] = conditional_particle_filter(ReducedForm,Y,start,DynareOptions)
% 
% Evaluates the likelihood of a non-linear model with a particle filter
% - the proposal is built using the Kalman updating step for each particle. 
% - we need draws in the errors distributions 
% Whether we use Monte-Carlo draws from a multivariate gaussian distribution 
% as in Amisano & Tristani (JEDC 2010). 
% Whether we use multidimensional Gaussian sparse grids approximations: 
% - a univariate Kronrod-Paterson Gaussian quadrature combined by the Smolyak 
% operator (ref: Winschel & Kratzig, 2010). 
% - a spherical-radial cubature (ref: Arasaratnam & Haykin, 2009a,2009b).
% - a scaled unscented transform cubature (ref: Julier & Uhlmann 1997, van der 
% Merwe & Wan 2003).
% 
% Pros: 
% - Allows using current observable information in the proposal 
% - The use of sparse grids Gaussian approximation is much faster than the Monte-Carlo approach 
% Cons: 
% - The use of the Kalman updating step may biais the proposal distribution since 
% it has been derived in a linear context and is implemented in a nonlinear
% context. That is why particle resampling is performed.
