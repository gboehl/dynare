function [x, errorflag, info] = trust_region(objfun, x, j1, j2, jacobianflag, gstep, tolf, tolx, maxiter, factor, debug, varargin)

% Solves systems of non linear equations of several variables, using a
% trust-region method.
%
% INPUTS
% - objfun         [function handle, char]      name of the routine evaluating the system of nonlinear equations (and possibly jacobian).
% - x              [double]                     n×1 vector, initial guess for the solution.
% - j1             [integer]                    vector, equation indices defining a subproblem to be solved.
% - j2             [integer]                    vector, unknown variable indices to be solved for in the subproblem.
% - jacobianflag   [logical]                    scalar, if true the jacobian matrix is expected to be returned as a second output argument when calling objfun, otherwise
%                                               the jacobian is computed numerically.
% - gstep          [double]                     scalar, increment multiplier in numerical derivative computation (only used if jacobianflag value is false).
% - tolf           [double]                     scalar, tolerance for residuals.
% - tolx           [double]                     scalar, tolerance for solution variation.
% - maxiter        [integer]                    scalar, maximum number of iterations;
% - factor         [double]                     scalar, determines the initial step bound.
% - debug          [logical]                    scalar, dummy argument.
% - varargin:      [cell]                       list of additional arguments to be passed to objfun.
%
% OUTPUTS
% - x              [double]                     n⨱1 vector, solution of the nonlinear system of equations.
% - errorflag      [logical]                    scalar, false iff nonlinear solver is successful.
% - info           [integer]                    scalar, information about the failure.
%
% REMARKS
% [1] j1 and j2 muyst have the same number of elements.
% [2] debug is here for compatibility purpose (see solve1), it does not affect the output.
% [3] Possible values for info are:
%
%       -1 if the initial guess is a solution of the nonlinear system of equations.
%        0 if the nonlinear solver failed because the problem is ill behaved at the initial guess.
%        1 if the nonlinear solver found a solution.
%        2 if the maximum number of iterations has been reached.
%        3 if spurious convergence (trust region radius is too small).
%        4 if iteration is not making good progress, as measured by the improvement from the last 15 iterations.
%        5 if no further improvement in the approximate solution x is possible (xtol is too small).
