% [dynpp_derivs, dyn_derivs] = k_order_perturbation(dr,M_,options_)
% computes a k-th order perturbation solution
%
% INPUTS
% dr:            struct   describing the reduced form solution of the model.
% M_:            struct   jobs's parameters
% options_:      struct   job's options
%
% OUTPUTS
% dynpp_derivs   struct   Derivatives of the decision rule in Dynare++ format.
%                         The tensors are folded and the Taylor coefficients (1/n!) are
%                         included.
%                         Fieldnames are g_0, g_1, g_2, …
% dyn_derivs     struct   Derivatives of the decision rule in Dynare format, up to third order.
%                         Matrices are dense and unfolded. The Taylor coefficients (1/2
%                         and 1/6) aren't included.
%                         The derivatives w.r.t. different categories of variables
%                         are separated.
%                         Fieldnames are:
%                          + gy, gu
%                          + if order ≥ 2: gyy, gyu, guu, gss
%                          + if order ≥ 3: gyyy, gyyu, gyuu, guuu, gyss, guss
