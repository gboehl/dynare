% [unc_welfare, U_dynpp_derivs, W_dynpp_derivs, U_dyn_derivs, W_dyn_derivs] = k_order_welfare(dr, DynareModel, DynareOptions)
% computes a k-th order approximation of welfare
%
% INPUTS
% dr:              struct   describing the reduced form solution of the model.
% DynareModel:     struct   jobs's parameters
% DynareOptions:   struct   job's options
%
% OUTPUTS
%
% unc_welfare      double   approximation of conditional welfare from the non-stochastic steady state and allowing stochastic shocks
%
% U_dynpp_derivs   struct   Derivatives of the felicity function in Dynare++ format.
%                         The tensors are folded and the Taylor coefficients (1/n!) are
%                         included.
%                         Fieldnames are U_0, U_1, U_2, …

% U_dyn_derivs     struct   Derivatives of the felicity function in Dynare format, up to third order.
%                         Matrices are dense and unfolded. The Taylor coefficients (1/2
%                         and 1/6) aren't included.
%                         The derivatives w.r.t. different categories of variables
%                         are separated.
%                         Fieldnames are:
%                          + Uy, Uu
%                          + if order ≥ 2: Uyy, Uyu, Uuu, Uss
