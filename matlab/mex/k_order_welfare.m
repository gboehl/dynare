% computes a k-th order approximation of welfare
%
% INPUTS
% dr:              struct   describing the reduced form solution of the model.

% OUTPUTS
%
% W                struct   Derivatives of the welfare function in Dynare++ format.
%                         The tensors are folded and the Taylor coefficients (1/n!) are
%                         included.
%                         Fieldnames are W_0, W_1, W_2, …
