function k = symmetric_matrix_index(i,j,n)
% function k = symmetric_matrix_index(i,j,n)
% Returns index number of variable combination (i,j) in vech(A) where A is
% an symmetric n by n matrix and vech creates row vector by stacking rows
% of A on and above the diagonal
%
% Inputs:
%   i   [scalar]    index of first variable
%   j   [scalar]    index of second variable
%   n   [scalar]    number of variables
% Outputs:
%   k   [scalar]    index of variable combination in vech(A)
