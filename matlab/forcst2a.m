function yf=forcst2a(y0,dr,e)
% function yf=forcst2a(y0,dr,e)
% computes forecasts based on first order model solution, assuming the absence of shocks
% Inputs:
%   - y0        [endo_nbr by maximum_endo_lag]          matrix of starting values
%   - dr        [structure]                             structure with Dynare decision rules
%   - e         [horizon by exo_nbr]                    matrix with shocks
%
% Outputs:
%   - yf        [horizon+maximum_endo_lag,endo_nbr]               matrix of forecasts
