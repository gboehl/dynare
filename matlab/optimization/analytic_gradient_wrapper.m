%function [fval, grad, hess, exitflag]=analytic_gradient_wrapper(x, fcn, varargin)
% Encapsulates an objective function to be minimized for use with Matlab
% optimizers
%
% INPUTS
% - x             [double]    n*1 vector of instrument values.
% - fcn           [fhandle]   objective function.
% - varagin       [cell]      additional parameters for fcn.
%
% OUTPUTS
% - fval          [double]    scalar, value of the objective function at x.
% - grad                      gradient of the objective function
% - hess                      Hessian of the objective function
% - exit_flag     [integer]   scalar, flag returned by
