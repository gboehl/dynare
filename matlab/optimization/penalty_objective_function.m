function [fval, exit_flag, arg1, arg2] = penalty_objective_function(x, fcn, base_penalty, varargin)

% Encapsulates an objective function to be minimized, adding a penalty if necessary.
%
% INPUTS
% - x             [double]    n*1 vector of instrument values.
% - fcn           [fhandle]   objective function.
% - base_penalty  [double]    scalar, base of the penality (typically the value of the objective at the previous iteration).
% - varagin       [cell]      additional parameters for fcn.
%
% OUTPUTS
% - fval          [double]    scalar, value of the objective function at x.
% - exit_flag     [integer]   scalar, flag returned by fcn (third output).
% - arg1, arg2                fourth and fifth output arguments of the objective function.
