function y2 = dynvars_from_endo_simul(y, it_, M_)
% Given the matrix y of paths for all endogenous (same format as
% oo_.endo_simul), and an iteration number (first simulation period corresponds
% to it_=M_.maximum_lag+1), return a vector of endogenous values in the format
% expected by the dynamic.m file (i.e. whose indices are described by
% M_.lead_lag_incidence)
