function [mhname,info] = get_name_of_the_last_mh_file(M_)
% This function returns the name of the last mh file and test if the metropolis was completed.
%
% INPUTS
%   M_       [structure]   Dynare structure specifying the model.
%
% OUTPUTS
%  mhname    [string]      Name of the last mh file (with complete path).
%  info      [integer]     Scalar. If info is equal to 1 then the predicted name of the last
%                          metropolis hastings matches the name of the name of the last mh
%                          file. Otherwise info is equal to zero (a likely reason for this is
%                          that the mcmc simulations were not completed).
