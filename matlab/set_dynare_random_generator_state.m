function [state_u,state_n] = set_dynare_random_generator_state(state_u,state_n)
% Wet state of Matlab/Octave random generator depending on matlab
% (octave) version.
% In older versions, Matlab kept one generator for uniformly distributed numbers and
% one for normally distributed numbers.
% For backward compatibility, we return two vectors, but, in recent
% versions of Matlab and in Octave, we return two identical vectors.
