function print(varexpectationmodelname, withcalibration)

% Prints the exansion of the VAR_EXPECTATION term in files.
%
% INPUTS
% - varepxpectationmodelname       [string]    Name of the expectation model.
% - withcalibration                [logical]   Prints calibration if true.
%
% OUTPUTS
% None
%
% REMARKS
% The routine creates two text files
%
% - {varexpectationmodelname}-parameters.inc     which contains the declaration of the parameters specific to the expectation model kind term.
% - {varexpectationmodelname}-expression.inc     which contains the expanded version of the expectation model kind term.
%
% These routines are saved under the {modfilename}/model/varexpectationmodel subfolder, and can be used
% after in another mod file (ie included with the macro directive @#include). A matlab routine is also
% created for evaluating (dseries) the var-expectations.
