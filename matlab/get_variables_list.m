function [ivar, vartan, options_] = get_variables_list(options_, M_)

% This function builds a vector of indices in varlist or varobs.
%
% INPUTS
%   o options_   [structure]             Describes global options.
%   o M_         [structure]             Describes the model.
%
% OUTPUTS
%   o ivar       [integer]               nvar*1 vector of indices (nvar is the number
%                                        of variables).
%   o vartan     [cell of char arrays]   array of characters (with nvar rows).
%   o options_   [structure]             Describes global options.
