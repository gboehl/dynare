function [pnames, enames, xnames, pid, eid, xid] = get_variables_and_parameters_in_equation(lhs, rhs, DynareModel)

% Returns the lists of parameters, endogenous variables and exogenous variables in an equation.
%
% INPUTS
% - lhs         [string]            Left hand side of an equation.
% - rhs         [string]            Right hand side of an equation.
% - DynareModel [struct]            Structure describing the current model (M_).
%
% OUTPUTS
% - pnames      [cell]              Cell of row char arrays (p elements), names of the parameters.
% - enames      [cell]              Cell of row char arrays (n elements), names of the endogenous variables.
% - xnames      [cell]              Cell of row char arrays (m elements), names of the exogenous variables.
% - pid         [Integer]           p*1 vector of indices in M_.param_names for the listed parameters in params.
% - eid         [Integer]           n*1 vector of indices in M_.endo_names for the listed parameters in endogenous.
% - xid         [Integer]           m*1 vector of indices in M_.exo_names for the listed parameters in exogenous.
