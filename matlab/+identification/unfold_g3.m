function g3_unfolded = unfold_g3(g3, ny)
% Given the 3rd order derivatives stored in a sparse matrix and without
% symmetric elements (as returned by the static/dynamic files) and the number
% of (static or dynamic )variables in the jacobian, returns
% an unfolded version of the same matrix (i.e. with symmetric elements).
