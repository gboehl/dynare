function rnd = wblrnd(a, b)
% This function produces independent random variates from the Weibull distribution.
%
%  INPUTS
%    a       [double]    m*n matrix of positive parameters (scale).
%    b       [double]    m*n matrix of positive parameters (shape).
%
%  OUTPUT
%    rnd     [double]    m*n matrix of independent variates from the beta(a,b) distribution.
