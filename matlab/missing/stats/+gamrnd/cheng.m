function  g = cheng(a, b)

% Returns gamma variates, see Devroye (1986) page 413 and Cheng (JRRS, 1977).
%
% INPUTS
% - a    [double]     n*1 vector, first hyperparameter.
% - b    [double]     n*1 vector, second hyperparameter.
%
% OUTPUTS
% - g    [double]     n*1 vector, gamma variates.
%
% REMARKS
% The definition of aa is wrong in Devroye (1986).
