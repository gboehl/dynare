% For solve_algo={12,14}, precompute the function handles for per-block dynamic files
% (it is surprisingly costly to recompute them within simulation loops).
% Also precompute indices of feedback variables (also brings some performance gains).
% By the way, do other sanity checks on block decomposition.
