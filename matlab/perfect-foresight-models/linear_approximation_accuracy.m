function err = linear_approximation_accuracy(options_, M_, oo_)
% Evaluates the accuracy of the linear approximation when solving perfect foresight models, by
% reporting the max absolute value of the dynamic residuals.
%
% INPUTS
% - options_ [struct] contains various options.
% - M_       [struct] contains a description of the model.
% - oo_      [struct] contains results.
%
% OUTPUTS
% - err      [double] n*1 vector, evaluation of the accuracy (n is the number of equations).
