function y = log_variable(ivar,x,M)
% returns the log of an endogenous variables except if
% it is a lagged/leaded exogenous variable
%
% INPUT
% ivar: vector of variable indices (in declaration order)
% x:    vector of variables value
% M:    model structure
%
% OUTPUT
% y:    log of the selected variables if there are not auxiliary variables
%       for lagged/leaded exogenous variables
