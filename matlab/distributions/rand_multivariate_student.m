%
% INPUTS
%
%    Mean               [double]    1*n vector, expectation of the multivariate random variable.
%    Sigma_upper_chol   [double]    n*n matrix, upper triangular Cholesky decomposition of Sigma
%                                   (the covariance matrix up to a factor df/(df-2)).
%    df                 [integer]   degrees of freedom.
%
% OUTPUTS
%    draw               [double]    1*n vector drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with expectation Mean and
%                                   covariance Sigma.

%    Computes the t-distributed random numbers from
%       X = \mu + Y\sqrt{\frac{\nu}{U}}
%   where
%       Y~N(0,Sigma) with Sigma=Sigma_upper_chol'*Sigma_upper_chol
%       U~\Chi^2_{\nu}
%   The latter is constructed as the sum of \nu standard normals.
